This is a collection of modules stolen from the Activeware port
and modified so that they will build under MakeMaker using perls
greater than 5.003_97j.  The following extensions have been
"ported":

    Win32/EventLog
    Win32/File
    Win32/FileSecurity
    Win32/Registry
    Win32/Service
    Win32/WinError

All of the extensions have been re-engineered to use the XS
interface language (and are hence in pure C).

Building:

    + You need to extract this into an NTFS file system (the
      tests in the FileSecurity module will fail otherwise.)
   
    + You need MS Visual C++ (ver. 2.0 and above).
   
    + perl Makefile.PL
   
    + nmake
   
    + nmake test					[optionally]
   
    + nmake install

I hope this kickstarts the process of bringing the divergant Win32::
extensions back into the MakeMaker fold.

The following modules available in the Activeware port are not
available in this one:

    Win32/ChangeNotify
    Win32/IPC
    Win32/Mutex
    Win32/NetAdmin
    Win32/NetResource
    Win32/Process
    Win32/Semaphore

Of these, NetAdmin and NetResource are almost done (I haven't debugged
a few problems yet).  The others either use the CPerl object, or
use additional C++ objects, and VC2.0 seems unable to mix the perl
headers and C++.

Suggestions, patches, rewrites and additional ports of modules welcome.
