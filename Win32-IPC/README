Win32-IPC version $%v%$

The Win32-IPC modules provide access to the Win32 sychronization
objects, which are (currently) documented at

  http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686364(VS.85).aspx

The supported sychronization objects and associated modules are:
  Event     - Win32::Event
  Mutex     - Win32::Mutex
  Semaphore - Win32::Semaphore

In addition, the Win32::ChangeNotify module provides access to
directory change notifications, which let you monitor a specified
directory tree for file modifications.  While not strictly a
synchronization object, change notifications are often used in similar
ways.



INSTALLATION

To install these modules, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	Build
	Build test
	Build install



DEPENDENCIES

You'll need a suitable C compiler.
Microsoft Visual C++ 6 or MinGW GCC should work.
You can also build it with GCC under Cygwin.
