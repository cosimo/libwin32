Revision history for the Perl Win32-IPC modules.

1.06  April 15, 2008
	- *** INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ***

	  Passing undef as the value of an optional parameter is now
	  the same as omitting that parameter.	In previous versions,
	  undef was interpreted as either the empty string or 0 (along
	  with a warning about "Use of uninitialized value...").

	  In particular, if you pass undef as the timeout, it now
	  means INFINITE, but to previous versions it meant 0.

	- The modules now use XSLoader instead of DynaLoader.

	- Copied Yves Orton's fix (from Win32::ChangeNotify 1.04) so
	  "a true value" no longer has to be a non-zero number to all
	  relevant places.

	- Win32::IPC and its subclasses are now distributed separately
	  from libwin32 (which has been broken up).  Prior to this
	  release, each module had its own Changes file, and their
	  version numbers were not synchronized.  Those files are
	  appended below.
