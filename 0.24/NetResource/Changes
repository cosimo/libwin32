Revision history for Perl extension Win32::NetResource.

0.053 Mon Jul  8 16:44:32 2002
	- added missing STYPE_* and SHARE_* constants
	- fixed NetShareCheck() to uppercase the device argument appropriately
	- functions that took out-parameters weren't setting them correctly
	- GetUNCName() could fail if forward slashes were used
	- NetShareCheck() and GetUNCName() are documented a bit better
	- added an example of using GetSharedResources() to enumerate
	  resources on a particular host

0.052 Mon Nov 12 23:21:52 2001
	- NetShareGetInfo() didn't work when passed a hashref as \%share
	- pointers to various stack variables were being used outside
	  their scope
	- Allow GetSharedResources() to accept an optional third argument
	  that specifies a particular net resource to enumerate; fixes
	  arbitrary failure of tests (patch from <Luc_St-Louis@lgs.ca>)
