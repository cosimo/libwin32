Win32 - Interfaces to some Win32 API Functions

This module contains interfaces to some Win32 API functions, grouped
together purely for historical reasons.  Most of the functions were
copied from the "Perl for Win32" version of Perl 5.003_07 from
ActiveWare, but moved out of the core into a module to try to stop
bloating the core Perl library.

The Win32 module is part of core Perl starting with Perl 5.8.4.
It is being maintained by Jan Dubois <jand@activestate.com>.

Starting with Win32 version 0.27 it also contains all the remaining
Win32::* function that are statically built into the core to make them
upgradeable via CPAN too (except for Win32::SetChildShowWindows(),
which is tightly coupled with the core implementation).

This module is free software; you may redistribute it and/or modify it
under the same terms as Perl itself.
