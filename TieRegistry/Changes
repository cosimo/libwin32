Revision history for Perl extension Win32::TieRegistry.

0.23  Sat Jul  3 00:06:20 1999
	- Fixed two embarrassing typographical errors.
	- Using invalid REG_* or KEY_* constant as string now detected.
	- With ArrayValues(1), $key->{NonExistantValueName} used to return
	  C<[]> but now returns C<undef> [or C<()>].  Old code like
	  C<if( $reg->{value}->[0] )> should still work but now can be
	  improved to C<if( $reg->{value} )> [which used to always be true
	  when the ArrayValues option was enabled].
	- All implicit C<return>s made explicit [C<$val;> to C<return $val;>].
	- Simplified C<return wantarray ? () : undef> to C<return ()>.

0.22  Fri Apr  9 22:13:52 1999
	- C<new Win32::TieRegistry> and "Win32::TieRegistry->new" now work.
	- CreateKey()'s "disposition" argument now can get its string value
	  set to "REG_CREATED_NEW_KEY" or "REG_OPENED_EXISTING_KEY".
	- GetOptions()'s fancier usages defined.
	- New documentation section on exports [C<use> and C<import()>].
	- New documentation section on best ways to use symbolic constants.
	- New documentation section on probable future directions.
	- Minor documentation fixes.

0.21  Thu Sep 17 14:49:26 1998
	- Remove a few "harmless" warnings reported by C<-w>.

0.20  Tue Jul 14 14:14:54 1998
	- Renamed to Win32::TieRegistry.
	- Added options:  SplitMultis, FixSzNulls,
	    DWordToHex, DualBinVals, and DualTypes.
	- Added hooks for future option, TieValues.
	- Most methods now return a tied ref. if called via one:
	    Open(), Load(), Connect(), and CreateKey().
	- Changed import() to support setting options.
	- More options on what to "export" and to where.
	- Each time you C<use>, you get a _separate copy_ of $Registry.
	- New methods:  Clone(), GetOptions(), and SetOptions().
	- Flush() no longer calls RegFlushKey() by default.
	- Optimize deletes to be faster in void contexts.
	- If delete OK but fetch of old val failed, have C<delete> return $^E.
	- "Disposition" option to CreateKey() no longer considered invalid.
	- CreateKey() always used OS_Delimiter to parse subkey paths.
	- Load()'s second argument can now be new subkey name.
	- Load() via remote key w/o specific new subkey name no longer tries
	    to load into _local_ LMachine.
	- Finished POD.

0.15  Tue Jul 14 14:14:54 1998
	- "Stub" version of Tie::Registry for backward compatibility only.

0.14  Never released
	- Added Install.bat for people without a version of "make".
	- Report key path when STORE fails.

0.13  Tue Mar 31 20:50:28 1998
	- "Delimiter" now spelled correctly throughout (sigh).
	- SetValue now translates "REG_*" strings to numeric constants.
	- Removed dependance on $^E being tied to Win32::GetLastError().

0.12  Mon Dec 29 10:11:30 1997
