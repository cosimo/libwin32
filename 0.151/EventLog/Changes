Revision history for Perl extension Win32::EventLog.

0.062 (unreleased)
    - fix for memory leak in EventLog due to lack of DESTROY()
      (suggested by Jan Dubois <jand@activestate.com>)
    - Report() method uses 'Source' and 'Computer' fields in passed
      hashref if they exist, and uses the same fields from the EventLog
      object if they don't.  NOTE: THIS IS A POTENTIAL COMPATIBILITY
      ISSUE.
