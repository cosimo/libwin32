Revision history for Perl extension Win32::Shortcut.

0.04 September 2005
    - The Save() function now calls Win32::GetLongPathName() on the filename
      to make sure to use a fully qualified pathname.

    - The Save() will store the new filename as the 'File' property unless
      the Shortcut object already has a 'File' property.

0.03
    - The PLL file now comes in 2 versions, one for Perl version 5.001 (build 110)
      and one for Perl version 5.003 (build 300 and higher, EXCEPT 304).
    - Added an installation program which will automatically copy the right files
      in the right place.
