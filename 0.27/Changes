Revision history for the Perl extension Win32.

0.27	[2007-03-07]
	- Extracted from the libwin32 distribution to simplify maintenance
	  because Win32 is a dual-life core module since 5.8.4.

	- Win32.pm and Win32.xs updated to version in bleadperl.
	  This includes all the Win32::* function from win32/win32.c
	  in core Perl, except for Win32::SetChildShowWindows().

	- Install into 'perl' directory instead of 'site' for Perl 5.8.4
	  and later.

	- Add some simple tests
