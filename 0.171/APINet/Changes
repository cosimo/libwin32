Revision history for Perl extension Win32API::Net

0.081   Mon May 22 20:38:11 2000
        - support for building under Perl v5.6.0.
	- fixed a leak due to improper freeing in UserGetInfo()
	  (thanks to Eamon Doyle <eamon.doyle@cp.net>)

0.08	Thu Sep  24th 1999
	- Changed logic relating to passing empty strings in as values
	  in input hashes. The old behaviour turned such strings into
	  NULL pointers. The API treats NULL pointers as an indication
	  to not change the stored value for that field.  Now fields
	  with empty strings pass an empty string to the underlying API
	  structure correctly (enabling a field to be clear fields
	  e.g. logonScript).  To pass a NULL pointer to the underlying
	  API, the field must now be set to undef.  NOTE: THIS IS AN
	  INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE.  IF YOU WERE RELYING ON PRIOR BEHAVIOR
	  BY SETTING FIELDS TO EMPTY STRINGS, YOUR SCRIPT MAY NEED
	  TO BE MODIFIED.

0.07	Thu Jul  1st 1999
	- Added USER_BAD_PW_COUNT_PARMNUM to User export tag
	  Changed incorrect spelling of UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWORD
	  to UF_DONT_EXPIRE_PASSWD in Net.pm
	  (both errors reported by Eamon Doyle <eamon.doyle@isocor.ie>)

0.06	Tue Jun 22nd 1999
	- Changed all occurances of 'na' to 'pl_na'
	- Fixed bug in UserGetLocalGroups that was only apparent when trying
	  to use LG_INCLUDE_INDIRECT() as the optional forth argument

0.05	Thu Feb  4th 1999
	- Fixed bug in GroupGetInfo
	- Added support for level 2 in GroupGetInfo

0.04	Sun Sep 14th 1998
	- use Perl's malloc API instead of calloc/free
	- eliminate hardcoded module names in messages etc
	- minor formatting fixes
	- convert HTML doc to POD, but distribute original (better) HTML
	- eliminate use of file statics

0.03	Sun Sep 13th 1998
	- changed EXPORT lists to be something sane (EXPORT is null list,
	  EXPORT_TAGS has tags for each function group (User, Group etc) and
	  EXPORT_OK is join of EXPORT_TAGS entries)
	- Changed name of GetPDC to GetDCName to bring it in line with MS
	  function NetGetDCName()
	- Updated documentation and test script
		  
0.02    Thu Sep 10th 1998
	- second version - renamed as Win32API::Net
	- fixed indentation in Net.xs to be in Perl Sytle
	- Removed GetLastError() function - now availble as Win32::GetLastError
	  and $^E (if you're running 5.005+)
	- Added @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and $EXPORT_TAGS{ALL} in Net.pm

0.01    Sun Apr 19th
	- first version - named Win32::AccNT
