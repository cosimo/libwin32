History of Win32::API perl extension.

2008-02-23  Win32::API v0.50     Cosimo

   - Fixed RT #31702 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=31702)
     Thanks to RUrban for supplying the fix.

2008-02-20  Win32::API v0.49     Cosimo

   - Fixed the stack cleanup assembler statements for GCC in API.xs, I hope.
   - Fixed a Borland C macro definition in API.xs
   - Fixed META.yml (stupid me)

2008-02-20  Win32::API v0.48     Cosimo

   - Finally applied the cdecl/stdcall patch available since long time
     from http://www.xs4all.nl/~itsme/projects/perl/.
     Now Win32::API *can* work with cdecl DLLs.
     Fixes RT #32424 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=32424)
       and RT #24685 (http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=24685)
     Thanks to Willem Jan Hengeveld (itsme at xs4all.nl) for your great work.
     Thanks to JimK for a test case and to BrowserUk and others at PerlMonks
     for providing me useful information and complaints. :-)

     However, still missing some GCC assembler magic for stack cleanup.
     Any help?

   - Clarified licensing info. Yes, Win32::API is available with
     GPL 2 / Artistic license.

2007-11-12  Win32::API v0.47     Cosimo

   - Nothing exciting. Fixed warning on DATA filehandle.
     Reported by Dmitri Karasik. Build passed on Windows Vista.
     Fixes RT #30674 (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30674)

2006-12-23  Win32::API v0.46     Cosimo

   - Test suite now passes on MSVC6, MSVC7, GCC/MinGW and Cygwin.
     A lot of skips and segfaults on doubles/floats should be examined,
     though. But now it's possible to cleanly install from CPAN!

   - API_test.dll building phase has been removed. Now there is only
     a prebuilt version of it, suitable for all compilers to link and
     use, I hope.
  
     Why does Cygwin gcc compile an entirely different API_test.dll?
     I checked the tdump of msvc and gcc and the gcc version is
     missing all the kernel32 imports. I don't know why this happens.

   - Removed README.txt file. Now there's only README.

2006-11-29  Win32::API v0.45     Cosimo

   - What a mess! Restored GCC/MinGW compile that broke with that
     damned assembler macros...

2006-11-28  Win32::API v0.44     Cosimo

   - Fixed compile under MSVC broken with GCC/MinGW last changes.

2006-11-28  Win32::API v0.43     Cosimo

   - Now Win32::API should cleanly *compile* on GCC / MinGW
     environment. This has been tested only Vanilla Perl and
     only with Microsoft nmake.
     Test suite does not work with GCC. You can only test that
     Win32::API extension works running manually the t\99_GetProcess.t
     test script.
     This improvement comes thanks to the 0.42 patches I found
     and collected from the internet, though I don't know who
     is the guy that wrote them first. Anyway, thank you!

   - There are problems with current ExtUtils::MakeMaker (6.31 and
     also blead, I believe) version and dmake generated Makefiles.
     I'm trying to understand what to do here.

   - Win32::API::Type now doesn't have a INIT block anymore, that
     seems to be the cause of all evils on this module.
     Please you out there report your findings on this.

   - Last but not least. Current maintainer of Win32::API is now
     Cosimo Streppone (me), cosimo at cpan.org. I'm not very
     skilled on Win32 development, but I'm trying to to work out the
     CPAN bugs queue. Thanks to Aldo for handing me his wonderful
     work maintainance.
