* Review Win32::API::Struct

  1) make code style consistent
  2) remove warnings
  3) implement test cases for the various structure types,
     including compound structures, struct containing arrays,
	 and types non aligned to 4 bytes
  4) implement a 64-bit flag, so that all word sizes are automatically
     calculated as 8 bytes instead of hardwiring 4 bytes
