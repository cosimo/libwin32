Revision history for Perl extension libwin32.


0.10  Fri Feb  6 21:32:33 1998

   + Chris Madsen <ac608@yfn.ysu.edu> has rethought and rewritten the IPC
     related modules.  The Win32::Event module is new.  In his own words:

	The Win32::IPC modules

		Win32::ChangeNotify
		Win32::Event
		Win32::IPC
		Win32::Mutex
		Win32::Semaphore

	have been almost completely rewritten and are now at version 1.00.
	The rather inconsistent ActiveWare interface is still supported, but
	you should really use the newer and more powerful interface (using
	lower case method names).

	Consult the documentation for each module for details on how to
	convert from the old interface.

	In addition, Win32::Process has been slightly altered to work with
	Win32::IPC.  Process objects should now work with Win32::IPC's wait_*
	functions (they were supposed to work before, but they didn't).  You
	will have to load Win32::IPC yourself, because Win32::Process does
	not.

   + Yet more OLE fixes from Jan Dubois <jan.dubois@ibm.net>.

   + NetAdmin enhancements from Jutta Klebe <jmk@exc.bybyte.de>

   + Updated FileSecurity to base version 0.67.

   + Win32::Registry sports additional functions that correspond to the
     Win32 Registry API functions.

   + Misc. changes
	- fixed buggy InitiateSystemShutdown()
	- New compatibility XSUBs: MsgBox(), LoadLibrary(), FreeLibrary(),
	  GetProcAddress(), RegisterServer(), UnregisterServer()

   + Other minor bugs have been fixed.  See "Changes" files in individual
     module subdirectories.

   + OLE has been seriously overhauled, thanks largely to the valiant efforts
     of Jan Dubois <jan.dubois@ibm.net>.  Jan has added many exciting new
     features, and a much more streamlined implementation.  See the pod
     documentation for compatibility info.

   + The AdminMisc extension has been dropped, because newer versions with
     support (and binaries) for the standard perl port are available from the
     original author.  See "http://www.rothd.net/perl" for details.

   + New compatibility functions (got via C<use Win32;>) : LookupAccountName(),
     LookupAccountSID(), InitiateSystemShutdown(), AbortSystemShutdown(),
     ExpandEnvironmentStrings().

   + Numerous bugs have been fixed.  See "Changes" files in individual module
     subdirectories.
