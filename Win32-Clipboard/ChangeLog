	GetBitmap() didn't work well except with 24 bit color images.
	The reason was that the CF_DIB data structure wasn't recognized
	correctly and consequently the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure wasn't
	generated correctly.

	I fixed the problem and now it work correctly with 1 bit
	(monochrome), 4 bit, 8 bit, 16 bit, 24 bit, and 32 bit colors as
	far as my testing goes.
