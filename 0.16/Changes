Revision history for Perl extension libwin32.


0.16  Mon May 22 22:16:41 2000

   + Support for building under Perl 5.6.0.
   
   + Partial support for passing Unicode strings to many of the extensions,
     under Perl 5.6.0.  Not all extensions support this yet.

   + Win32API-File has been upgraded to v0.09 (thanks to Tye McQueen).
     See APIFile/Changes for the detailed list of changes.  The
     APIFile/ex directory contains several new examples.

   + Win32API-Registry has been upgraded to v0.22 (thanks again to
     Tye McQueen).  See APIRegistry/Changes for the details on what's
     new.

   + Win32-Clipboard has been upgraded to v0.51 (thanks to Aldo
     Calpini).  This version has documentation in POD format, and
     supports three different formats to access clipboard data,
     and comes with sample code.  See Clipboard/README and the
     Clipboard/samples directory.

   + Win32-OLE has been upgraded to v0.13 (thanks to Jan Dubois
     <jand@activestate.com>).  The article on Win32::OLE from The Perl Journal
     is now included in POD format.  For the detailed list of changes, see
     OLE/Changes and OLE/lib/Win32/OLE/NEWS.pod.

   + Various minor cleanups and bug fixes.

   + A TODO file has been added.

0.151 Sun Sep 26 16:29:29 1999

   + The 5.00402 binaries were missing from the package.  Doh!

0.15  Sat Sep 25 15:53:02 1999

   + Win32API-File-0.07 has been added (thanks to Tye McQueen).  This module
     provides low-level access to file and directory functions.

   + Win32-OLE has been upgraded to v0.1101 (thanks to Jan Dubois).
     Be sure to check out the cool new component browser (needs IE5).
     Type "perldoc Win32::OLE::NEWS" and/or see OLE/Changes for detailed
     notes.

   + Win32API-Net has been upgraded to v0.08 (thanks to Bret Giddings).
     NOTE: There is a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY in how empty string values
     are handled in input hashes.
     See APINet/Changes and the pod documentation for detailed notes.

   + Win32API-Registry has been upgraded to v0.17 (from Tye McQueen).
     See APIRegistry/Changes for detailed notes.

   + Win32-TieRegistry has been upgraded to v0.23 (from Tye McQueen).
     See TieRegistry/Changes for detailed notes.

   + Win32-Sound has been upgraded to v0.45 (from Aldo Calpini).  The new
     version supports wave devices and volume controls, and also sports pod
     documentation.

   + A few bugs in Win32-EventLog have been fixed (thanks to Bret Giddings
     and Jan Dubois).  There is also newer documentation in pod format.
     NOTE: There is a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY in the Report() method,
     which will now use the "Source" and "Computer" fields in the passed
     hashref if they exist.
     See EventLog/Changes and the pod documentation for details.

   + A typo in Win32::Console::GenerateCtrlEvent() has been fixed.
     Documentation in pod format has been added (from Jan Dubois).

   + Win32::NetResource::GetSharedResources() now continues the enumeration
     when there are "Access denied" errors; on other errors, it enumerates
     all the resources seen until the point the error occurred.

   + Minor changes in Win32-ODBC from various people have been included.
     See ODBC/Changes for a summary.

   + Other small changes for Perl 5.005xx compatibility and minor bug
     fixes round out this release.

0.14  Sat Nov 14 23:02:59 1998

   + Support for building with mingw32/GCC from Nick Ing-Simmons.  Building
     many of the extensions is skipped, since the mingw32 libraries don't
     yet support all of the Win32 API.

   + Memory leaks fixed in PerfLib (thanks to Artur Silveira da Cunha).

   + EventLog now returns 'User' and 'Message' fields (thanks to Martin
     Pauley).

   + Other minor bugfixes.

0.13  Thu Sep 17 19:35:20 1998

   + New modules from Tye McQueen: Win32API-Registry-0.15 and
     Win32-TieRegistry-0.21.  These are much better designed and implemented
     than Win32-Registry.  They also begin the concerted effort to layer
     user-friendly implementations of Win32 functionality on top of a
     comprehensive set of Win32API-* modules.

   + New module from Bret Giddings: Win32API-Net-0.04 provides access to the
     Lan Manager API.  Currently supports only the account management
     functions, but the long-term intent is to support most of the Net* API.

   + Newer version of Win32::OLE from Jan Dubois.  See OLE/Changes for
     detailed list.

   + PerfLib bugs fixed (thanks to Jutta Klebe and Henry Ptasinski
     <henry@epigram.com>).

   + Subversive use of LDLOADLIBS in Internet/Makefile.PL fixed.

   + Fixed GPF in NetAdmin::LocalGroupIsMember()

   + Win32::Registry now supports setting REG_NONE entries.  Spurious
     warnings on 'use' fixed.

   + install.bat has improved sanity checks (thanks to Tye McQueen).

   + Various tweaks to help PERL_OBJECT build

0.12  Mon May 11 00:32:33 1998

   + Applied serious OLE bugfixes from Jan Dubois for public release.

0.11  (unreleased)

   + Jutta Klebe has contributed a new module, Win32::PerfLib. It
     provides comprehensive facilities for accessing performance counters
     on Windows NT.  See the documentation in PerfLib/PerfLib.pm.

   + Many, many fixes and enhancements in Win32::OLE, thanks to Jan Dubois
     See OLE/Changes for a detailed list.

   + Win32::NetAdmin supports new functions: GetAliasFromRID(),
     GetUserGroupFromRID(), LocalGroupGetMembersWithDomain(), and
     GetServerDisks() (thanks to David Gardiner and Jutta Klebe).
     A few broken constants have been fixed and missing ones added
     (thanks to Dave Roth).  Most symbols are exported on request
     (thanks to Tye McQueen).

   + Bug fixes for Win32::ChangeNotify (from Chris Madsen, thanks).

   + Win32::Registry exports older symbols for compatibility (thanks to
     Tye McQueen).  Reg*Key() functions enable priveleges as needed
     (thanks to Jutta Klebe).

   + Win32::Service now reports stopped services (merged from ActiveState's
     sources, thanks).

   + Win32::GetArchName() and Win32::GetChipName() functions have been
     added, for compatibility.

   + The bug whereby Win32::Process couldn't be loaded on Win95 should be
     fixed.

0.10  Fri Feb  6 21:32:33 1998

   + Chris Madsen <chris_madsen@geocities.com> has rethought and rewritten
     the IPC related modules.  The Win32::Event module is new.  In his own
     words:

	The Win32::IPC modules

		Win32::ChangeNotify
		Win32::Event
		Win32::IPC
		Win32::Mutex
		Win32::Semaphore

	have been almost completely rewritten and are now at version 1.00.
	The rather inconsistent ActiveWare interface is still supported, but
	you should really use the newer and more powerful interface (using
	lower case method names).

	Consult the documentation for each module for details on how to
	convert from the old interface.

	In addition, Win32::Process has been slightly altered to work with
	Win32::IPC.  Process objects should now work with Win32::IPC's wait_*
	functions (they were supposed to work before, but they didn't).  You
	will have to load Win32::IPC yourself, because Win32::Process does
	not.

   + Yet more OLE fixes from Jan Dubois <jand@activestate.com>.

   + NetAdmin enhancements from Jutta Klebe <jmk@exc.bybyte.de>

   + Updated FileSecurity to base version 0.67.

   + Win32::Registry sports additional functions that correspond to the
     Win32 Registry API functions.

   + Misc. changes
	- fixed buggy InitiateSystemShutdown()
	- New compatibility XSUBs: MsgBox(), LoadLibrary(), FreeLibrary(),
	  GetProcAddress(), RegisterServer(), UnregisterServer()

   + Other minor bugs have been fixed.  See "Changes" files in individual
     module subdirectories.

0.09  Sun Dec 14 12:14:08 1997

   + OLE has been seriously overhauled, thanks largely to the valiant efforts
     of Jan Dubois <jand@activestate.com>.  Jan has added many exciting new
     features, and a much more streamlined implementation.  See the pod
     documentation for compatibility info.

   + The AdminMisc extension has been dropped, because newer versions with
     support (and binaries) for the standard perl port are available from the
     original author.  See "http://www.rothd.net/perl" for details.

   + New compatibility functions (got via C<use Win32;>) : LookupAccountName(),
     LookupAccountSID(), InitiateSystemShutdown(), AbortSystemShutdown(),
     ExpandEnvironmentStrings().

   + Numerous bugs have been fixed.  See "Changes" files in individual module
     subdirectories.
