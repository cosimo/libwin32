This is a port of the OLE extensions distributed by Activeware
to the official perl distribution on Win32.  You will need
Perl version 5.004_01 or later to use this.

Installation is simple: you will need Visual C++ 2.x or above,
or Borland C++ 4.02 or above.

Do:

   perl Makefile.PL
   $make
   $make test
   $make install

where $make is either "nmake" or "dmake".

See the pod documentation for details of usage.

Please look into the compatibity section at the end of the
documentation if you were previously using the ActiveWare version
of the OLE extension! It also describes planned future changes that
might result in incompatibilities if you use undocumented features
of this module.
