Revision history for Perl extension Win32::OLE.

0.0809  (unreleased)

0.0808  (unreleased)

0.0807  (unreleased)
	- OleInitialize repleaced by CoInitializeEx(NULL, COINIT_MULTITHREADED)
	  (as suggested by James Snyder). This gets rid of the hidden top-level
	  window problem.
	- Fixed warning in Win32::OLE::Const when called without arg
	- todo: (Initialize/Uninitialize class methods no longer do anything)

0.0806  (unreleased)
	- Bug fixes for IsLocalMachine()
	- Free per-interpreter memory area at interpreter-exit
	- Bootstrap no longer static function
	- Use MY_VERSION as key/variable name for per-interpreter data

0.0805  (unreleased)
	- Never do CLSID lookup by registry on local machine
	- try to use socket APIs too to determine host identity
	- make all globals per-interpreter variables / remove DllMain
	- proper per-interpreter cleanup for all Perl versions

0.0804  (unreleased)
	- Fix breakage in GetOleObject (from 0.0801) for 5.004_04 and earlier
	- Ignore DCOM hostname if it seems to be the local machine

0.0803  (unreleased)
	- Rearrange t/3_ole.t to behave nicely when Excel is not installed
	- Win32::OLE->Dispatch: only warn about unidentifiable method name
	  when C<use strict "subs"> is in effect (kind of)
	- Most error msgs and warnings are prefixed with Win32::OLE version#

0.0802  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE->new(['Machine', 'Prog.Id']) does a remote registry lookup
	  if the Prog.Id is not registered locally.
	- CLSCTX changed to CLSCTX_REMOTE_SERVER when a machine is specified.
	  Otherwise OLE would still prefer a local server when available

0.0801  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE::Tie::(FETCH|STORE) now interpret $^H correctly
	- removed all Perl related stuff from DllMain (for embedded stuff)
	- Additional checks in GetOleObject for Perl 5.004_05 or later

0.08    Mon May 11 03:36:49 1998
	- Make sure mg_get() gets called during GetOleObject()

0.0615  (unreleased)
	- use SvIMMORTAL instead of SvREADONLY where applicable
	- use newCONSTSUB in Win32::OLE::Const to define inlineable functions

0.0614  (unreleased)
	- devel/dumprot.cpp removed, use IROTVIEW instead :-)
	- COSERVERINFO hack removed, requires MSC++ 4.2b or later now

0.0613  (unreleased)
	- WinOleEnum objects where never Safefree()d before
	- New Initialize/Uninitialize class methods. Uninitialize zombifies all
	  OLE objects and then calls OleUninitialize.

0.0612  (unreleased)
	- new Win32::OLE->SpinMessageLoop() class method
	- Messageloop will be emptied before OleUnitialize is called
	  (thanks to Steve Glassman for finding this problem!)

0.0611  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE::Tie::Store use DISPATCH_PROPERTYPUTREF for objects
	  (as suggested by Steve Biondi)
	- all OLE calls now automatically reset LastError
	- added devel/dumprot.cpp tool to distribution

0.0610  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE::Const now loads consts from all TKINDs and not only ENUMs
	- Win32::OLE::Variants are actually freed during DESTROY now
	- Misc. robustness fixes (VariantClear etc.)

0.0609  (unreleased)
	- Win32::OLE::LastError() returns $Win32::OLE::LastError

	  of DISP_E_EXCEPTION (as suggested by Steve Glassman)
	- misc. Get(WideChar|MultiByte) robustness enhancements
	- Win32::OLE::new now uses CLSTLX_SERVER
	-         "       allows specification of remote server name
	-         "          "         "       of numeric class id

	- use SvTRUE instead of SvIV to convert SV to VARIANT
	- REFCNT of returned SV for VT_ARRAY variant is now set correctly
	- SAFEARRAYs of VT_DISPATCH and VT_BSTR (and VT_VARIANT containing
	  those) are now handled correctly
	- folding of SAFEARRAYs removed again. Original structure is maintained
	  t/3_ole.t adjusted accordingly
	- Win32::OLE::Enum->All doesn't call Reset anymore

0.0605  (unreleased)
	- Property enumeration now dereferences TKIND_COCLASS etc.
	- Overloading in Win32::OLE now only enabled by OVERLOAD pseudotarget
	- Win32::OLE::CreateObject function for compatibility w/"Learning Perl"
	- Win32::OLE->LastError returns a dual value now (IV and PV)
	- Removed unsupported TKIND_ and VT_ constants from Win32::OLE::Variant

	  neutral setting didn't allow portable scripts either
	- Sample file type converter script in eg/word2xxx.pl
	- valof uses CP and LCID of arg class for variant conversion

	- new regression tests: unicode, variant
	- new sample: eg/word2pod.pl
	- first cut of NLS.pm module
