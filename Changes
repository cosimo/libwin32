Revision history for Perl extension libwin32.

0.27  6 March 2007

   + Identical to 0.26, except that the Win32 and the Win32API::File modules
     have been removed.  These modules are core Perl modules and are
     only available individually from CPAN.

0.26  17 September 2005

   + Updated the top level README file and some edits to this Changes file.
     Otherwise identical to 0.25.

0.25  16 September 2005

   + All libwin32 modules now compile with Microsoft VC++, cygwin and MingW.
     Thanks to Rafael Kitover and Reini Urban for all the work!

   + libwin32 now requires Perl 5.6.0 or later.

   + All support for Perl 5.005 style wide character Unicode support has been
     removed.  This code is incompatible with the way Perl 5.6 and later use
     Unicode (UTF8), and has been removed in Perl 5.8 (USING_WIDE is defined
     as constant 0).
 
   + Win32API::File

     - Added GetFileAttributes() function and corresponding constants.
       (Kenneth Olwing)

     - Applied cygwin patches from Rafael Kitover and Reini Urban.
       This includes the addition of the GetFileSize(), getFileSize()
       setFilePointer() and GetOverlappedResult() methods and the
       experimental new object oriented interface.  All file position
       operations use either Math::BigInt objects or 8 byte integers
      (cygwin) for file offsets.

   + Win32API::Registry

     - Add DELETE/READ_CONTROL/WRITE_DAC/WRITE_OWNER/SYNCHRONIZE as KEY_*.
       (Tye McQueen)

   + Win32::Clipboard

     - GetBitmap() should now work correctly with 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit,
       16 bit, 24 bit, and 32 bit colors. (Hideyo Imazu)

   + Win32::Console

     - Rename GRAY to LIGHTGRAY and add definitions for the "real" GRAY
       colors. (James K. Lowden)

     - Add get_Win32_IPC_HANDLE() method so that Win32::IPC can wait
       on a console handle. (Christopher J. Madsen)

     - Add SetIcon() method to change the icon of the window.
       (Christopher J. Madsen)

     - Don't export the scalar variables to %main:: but into the
       callers namespace. (Christopher J. Madsen)

   + Win32::IPC

     - Revised how WaitForMultiple handles non-Win32::IPC objects.
       (Christopher J. Madsen)

   + Win32::Process

     - Add get_Win32_IPC_HANDLE() method for Win32::IPC compatibility.
       (Christopher J. Madsen)

     - Add STILL_ACTIVE constant for GetExitCode().
       (suggested by Michael Ellery)

     - Add GetCurrentProcessID() for cygwin. (Reini Urban)

     - Win32::Process::Open() now records the process ID correctly
       for GetProcessID().  It also creates handle now that can be
       used with the Wait() method. (Christopher Allan)

   + Win32::Shortcut

     - The Save() function now calls Win32::GetLongPathName() on the filename
       to make sure to use a fully qualified pathname.

     - The Save() will store the new filename as the 'File' property unless
       the Shortcut object already has a 'File' property.

   + Win32::TieRegistry

     - Localize $@ in DESTORY method because it uses eval. (Eric Promislow)

0.24  14 February 2005

   + This release corresponds to libwin32 in ActivePerl 5.8.6.811.
     It is intended to be the baseline for applying accumulated
     patches.

0.22  (unreleased)

   + Win32::IsAdminUser() by Steve Hay has been added to Win32.xs.

0.21  (unreleased)

     memory leak in SetOption() and argument handling of the accept()
     and HttpOpenRequest() methods.

   + Win32::OLE updated to 0.17
     See OLE/changes for list of changes.

   + Win32::GetOSName() now identifies Windows 2003 as "Win2003".

0.191 Mon Jul  8 17:30:53 2002

   + Win32::Job is now available (thanks to Neil Watkiss).  This
     extension allows you to manipulate "job" objects (which are
     groups of processes) in Windows 2000 or later.  See the pod
     documentation for details.

   + Most modules that autoloaded their constants could reset $!
     during autoloading.  Such locations now localize $! before
     potentially modifying it.

   + EventLog has been upgraded to 0.073 (thanks to Brett Williams).
     EventLog/Changes has a list of bug fixes.

   + NetResource has been upgraded to 0.053.  See NetResource/Changes
     for the change log.

   + A Win32::GetOSName() function is now available.  It is documented
     in the Win32.pod distributed with perl 5.8.0-RC2 and with
     ActivePerl.

   + Some issues with building it under 5.8.0-RC2 have been fixed.

   + This release corresponds to the version of libwin32 included in

   + A typo in Win32::Console::GenerateCtrlEvent() has been fixed.
     Documentation in pod format has been added (from Jan Dubois).

   + Win32::NetResource::GetSharedResources() now continues the enumeration
     when there are "Access denied" errors; on other errors, it enumerates
     all the resources seen until the point the error occurred.

   + Minor changes in Win32-ODBC from various people have been included.
     See ODBC/Changes for a summary.

   + Other small changes for Perl 5.005xx compatibility and minor bug
     fixes round out this release.

0.14  Sat Nov 14 23:02:59 1998

   + Support for building with mingw32/GCC from Nick Ing-Simmons.  Building
     many of the extensions is skipped, since the mingw32 libraries don't
     yet support all of the Win32 API.

   + Memory leaks fixed in PerfLib (thanks to Artur Silveira da Cunha).

   + EventLog now returns 'User' and 'Message' fields (thanks to Martin
     Pauley).

   + Other minor bugfixes.

0.13  Thu Sep 17 19:35:20 1998

   + New modules from Tye McQueen: Win32API-Registry-0.15 and
     Win32-TieRegistry-0.21.  These are much better designed and implemented
     than Win32-Registry.  They also begin the concerted effort to layer
     user-friendly implementations of Win32 functionality on top of a
     comprehensive set of Win32API-* modules.

   + New module from Bret Giddings: Win32API-Net-0.04 provides access to the
     Lan Manager API.  Currently supports only the account management
     functions, but the long-term intent is to support most of the Net* API.

   + Newer version of Win32::OLE from Jan Dubois.  See OLE/Changes for
     detailed list.

   + PerfLib bugs fixed (thanks to Jutta Klebe and Henry Ptasinski
     <henry@epigram.com>).

   + Subversive use of LDLOADLIBS in Internet/Makefile.PL fixed.

   + Fixed GPF in NetAdmin::LocalGroupIsMember()

   + Win32::Registry now supports setting REG_NONE entries.  Spurious
     warnings on 'use' fixed.

   + install.bat has improved sanity checks (thanks to Tye McQueen).

   + Various tweaks to help PERL_OBJECT build

0.12  Mon May 11 00:32:33 1998

   + Applied serious OLE bugfixes from Jan Dubois for public release.

0.11  (unreleased)

   + Jutta Klebe has contributed a new module, Win32::PerfLib. It
     provides comprehensive facilities for accessing performance counters
     on Windows NT.  See the documentation in PerfLib/PerfLib.pm.

   + Many, many fixes and enhancements in Win32::OLE, thanks to Jan Dubois
     See OLE/Changes for a detailed list.

   + Win32::NetAdmin supports new functions: GetAliasFromRID(),
     GetUserGroupFromRID(), LocalGroupGetMembersWithDomain(), and
     GetServerDisks() (thanks to David Gardiner and Jutta Klebe).
     A few broken constants have been fixed and missing ones added
     (thanks to Dave Roth).  Most symbols are exported on request
     (thanks to Tye McQueen).

   + Bug fixes for Win32::ChangeNotify (from Chris Madsen, thanks).

   + Win32::Registry exports older symbols for compatibility (thanks to
     Tye McQueen).  Reg*Key() functions enable priveleges as needed
     (thanks to Jutta Klebe).

   + Win32::Service now reports stopped services (merged from ActiveState's
     sources, thanks).

   + Win32::GetArchName() and Win32::GetChipName() functions have been
     added, for compatibility.

   + The bug whereby Win32::Process couldn't be loaded on Win95 should be
     fixed.

0.10  Fri Feb  6 21:32:33 1998

   + Chris Madsen <chris_madsen@geocities.com> has rethought and rewritten
     the IPC related modules.  The Win32::Event module is new.  In his own
     words:

	The Win32::IPC modules

		Win32::ChangeNotify
		Win32::Event
		Win32::IPC
		Win32::Mutex
		Win32::Semaphore

	have been almost completely rewritten and are now at version 1.00.
	The rather inconsistent ActiveWare interface is still supported, but
	you should really use the newer and more powerful interface (using
	lower case method names).

	Consult the documentation for each module for details on how to
	convert from the old interface.

	In addition, Win32::Process has been slightly altered to work with
	Win32::IPC.  Process objects should now work with Win32::IPC's wait_*
	functions (they were supposed to work before, but they didn't).  You
	will have to load Win32::IPC yourself, because Win32::Process does
	not.

   + Yet more OLE fixes from Jan Dubois <jand@activestate.com>.

   + NetAdmin enhancements from Jutta Klebe <jmk@exc.bybyte.de>

   + Updated FileSecurity to base version 0.67.

   + Win32::Registry sports additional functions that correspond to the
     Win32 Registry API functions.

   + Misc. changes
	- fixed buggy InitiateSystemShutdown()
	- New compatibility XSUBs: MsgBox(), LoadLibrary(), FreeLibrary(),
	  GetProcAddress(), RegisterServer(), UnregisterServer()

   + Other minor bugs have been fixed.  See "Changes" files in individual
     module subdirectories.

0.09  Sun Dec 14 12:14:08 1997

   + OLE has been seriously overhauled, thanks largely to the valiant efforts
     of Jan Dubois <jand@activestate.com>.  Jan has added many exciting new
     features, and a much more streamlined implementation.  See the pod
     documentation for compatibility info.

   + The AdminMisc extension has been dropped, because newer versions with
     support (and binaries) for the standard perl port are available from the
     original author.  See "http://www.rothd.net/perl" for details.

   + New compatibility functions (got via C<use Win32;>) : LookupAccountName(),
     LookupAccountSID(), InitiateSystemShutdown(), AbortSystemShutdown(),
     ExpandEnvironmentStrings().

   + Numerous bugs have been fixed.  See "Changes" files in individual module
     subdirectories.
