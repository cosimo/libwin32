* Convert more extensions to a more complete API backend and an easy
  to use Perl front end (in the manner of Win32API::Registry and
  Win32::TieRegistry).

* The pod documentation in many of the extensions is woefully inadequate.
  Add more examples of use.

* More comprehensive test suite for the extensions that are missing
  them.

* Add the MSG_ constants to Win32.pm via ExtUtils::Myconst2perl
  (see APIRegistry/Makefile.PL for how it is used).

* Many of the extensions are missing export lists for convenient use.

* Audit extensions for questionable coding style.

* Rewrite Win32::Registry in terms of Win32::APIRegistry (purely in
  Perl).

* Add wide syscall support to the modules that are missing them.
